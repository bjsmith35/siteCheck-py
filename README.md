# siteCheck-py
This site checking program was designed using python version 3 and paramiko
To download python 3 go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once downloaded and installed under Mac OS X or Linux go to terminal (Ubuntu press ctrl-alt-t simultaneously, Mac OS X open spotlight 'Command-Spacebar' and type terminal).
type 'pip3 install paramiko' without quotes to install paramiko a ssh library needed for this to work, be sure to use pip3 as pip install paramiko will install for old pyton 2.7 version and will not work with this program. 
at this point edit the siteCheck.py program in your favorite editor (not getting caught up in notepad/vim/emacs/sublime/etc. wars!)
change the lines with '<' some message here '>' to the correct values like your email username and password, email address, site to check etc.
once finished run the script by either double clicking on it (may need to make it executable, in Linux and Mac Terminal do chmod 755 siteCheck.py) 
If all went well you should have received an email and restarted your device (light, computer, nuclear power plant! -- just kidding) 
If all did not go well make sure you have "less secure apps" allowed in gmail (you have a gmail account right?)
If you have checked and rechecked and this is not working for you and you would like to ask me for help (understand I am new at this, so while I am more than happy to help I may not know of have a way of testing your particular setup but I will try.)
you can reach me on gitter @bjsmith35
